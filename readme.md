# Capstone Overview

In this capstone course, you will apply various machine learning
knowledge and skills that you have learned as part of the previous
courses to solve some real-world industrial challenges.

## Project Scenario

Assume you are a new machine learning engineer in a Massive Open Online
Courses (MOOCs) startup called AI Training Room. In AI Training Room,
learners across the world can learn leading technologies such as Machine
Learning, AI, Data Science, Cloud, App development, etc. Your company
grows rapidly and reaches millions of learners in a very short period.

The learning topics of AI Training Room can be summarized in the
following word cloud:

Starting this year, your machine learning engineer team is working very
hard on a recommender system project. The main goal of this project is
to improve learners' learning experience via helping them quickly find
new interested courses and better paving their learning paths.
Meanwhile, with more learners interacting with more courses via your
recommender systems, your company's revenue may also be increased.

This project is currently at the Proof of Concept (PoC) phase so your
main focus at this moment is to explore and compare various machine
learning models and find one with the best performance in off-line
evaluations.

## Your Tasks

Your tasks in this project are summarized in the following workflow, and
you will be guided through them in hands-on labs.

More specifically, you will undertake the tasks of:

- Collecting and understanding data
- Performing exploratory data analysis on online course enrollments
    datasets
- Extracting Bag of Words (BoW) features from course textual content
- Calculating course similarity using BoW features
- Building content-based recommender systems using various
    unsupervised learning algorithms, such as:
  - Distance/Similarity measurements, K-means, Principal Component
        Analysis (PCA), etc.
- Building collaborative-filtering recommender systems using various
    supervised learning algorithms
  - K Nearest Neighbors, Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF),
        Neural Networks, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression,
        RandomForest, etc.
- Creating an insightful and informative slideshow and presenting it
    to your peers

If you have extra bandwidth, you can also deploy and demonstrate your
models via a web app built with `streamlit`. `Streamlit` is an
open-source app framework for Machine Learning and Data Science to
quickly demonstrate their works.

Your course recommender app where you select different recommendation
models and generate recommendations, may look like the following

This project is a great opportunity to showcase your machine learning
skills, and demonstrate your proficiency to potential employers.

## Grading Schema

- Graded Quizzes: **30 pts**
- Final presentation, peer-review: **70 pts**

## Development Environments

In this project, you have at least three development environments you
may choose from:

## Skills Network Labs

Skills Network Labs is a virtual lab environment reserved for the
exclusive use by the learners on IBM Developer Skills Network portals
and its partners.

## Use your local Python, Jupyter Notebook, and IDE

If you experience any issues with the above two cloud environments, you
may install Python and JupyterNotebook / JupyterLab on your own
environments like a desktop or laptop computer. All the notebooks and
data used in the capstone can be downloaded and executed locally.

## Watson Studio

For this project, you will use Watson Studio as your main development
environment. Watson Studio is a component of IBM Cloud Pak for Data, is
a suite of tools and a collaborative environment for data scientists,
data analysts, AI and machine learning engineers, and domain experts to
develop and deploy your projects.

## Next Steps

Now you should have a basic understanding of this capstone project.

In the next step of your project, you will start with collecting and
exploring the datasets.
